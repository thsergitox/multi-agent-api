      "abstract": "With the ever-growing concern for internet security, the field of quantum\ncryptography emerges as a promising solution for enhancing the security of\nnetworking systems. In this paper, 20 notable papers from leading conferences\nand journals are reviewed and categorized based on their focus on various\naspects of quantum cryptography, including key distribution, quantum bit\ncommitment, post quantum cryptography, and counterfactual quantum key\ndistribution. The paper explores the motivations and challenges of employing\nquantum cryptography, addressing security and privacy concerns along with\nexisting solutions. Secure key distribution, a critical component in ensuring\nthe confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information over a network, is\nemphasized in the discussion. The survey examines the potential of quantum\ncryptography to enable secure key exchange between parties, even when faced\nwith eavesdropping, and other applications of quantum cryptography.\nAdditionally, the paper analyzes the methodologies, findings, and limitations\nof each reviewed study, pinpointing trends such as the increasing focus on\npractical implementation of quantum cryptography protocols and the growing\ninterest in postquantum cryptography research. Furthermore, the survey\nidentifies challenges and open research questions, including the need for more\nefficient quantum repeater networks, improved security proofs for continuous\nvariable quantum key distribution, and the development of quantum resistant\ncryptographic algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Key distribution plays a fundamental role in cryptography. Currently, the\nquantum scheme stands as the only known method for achieving unconditionally\nsecure key distribution. This method has been demonstrated over distances of\n508 and 1002 kilometers in the measurement-device-independent and twin-field\nconfigurations, respectively. However, quantum key distribution faces\ntransmission distance issues and numerous side channel attacks since the basic\nphysical picture requires the use of quantum channels between users. Even when\nquantum repeater and quantum constellation are used, commercializing quantum\ncryptography on a large scale remains unattainable due to the considerable\nexpense and significant technical hurdles associated with establishing a global\nquantum network and facilitating mobile quantum communication. Here, by\ndiscovering the provable quantum one-way function, we propose another key\ndistribution scheme with unconditional security, named probability key\ndistribution, that promises users between any two distances to generate a fixed\nand high secret key rate. There are no quantum channels for exchanging quantum\nsignals between two legitimate users. Non-local entangled states can be\ngenerated, identified and measured in the equivalent virtual protocol and can\nbe used to extract secret keys. We anticipate that this discovery presents a\nparadigm shift in achieving unconditionally secure cryptography, thereby\nfacilitating its widespread application on a global scale.",

      "abstract": "Traditional cryptography is suffering a huge threat from the development of\nquantum computing. While many currently used public-key cryptosystems would be\nbroken by Shor's algorithm, the effect of quantum computing on symmetric ones\nis still unclear. The security of symmetric ciphers relies heavily on the\ndevelopment of cryptanalytic tools. Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the\nsecurity of symmetric primitives in the post-quantum world, it is significant\nto improve classical cryptanalytic methods using quantum algorithms. In this\npaper, we focus on two variants of differential cryptanalysis: truncated\ndifferential cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Based on\nthe fact that Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be used to find the linear\nstructures of Boolean functions, we propose two quantum algorithms that can be\nused to find high-probability truncated differentials and impossible\ndifferentials of block ciphers, respectively. We rigorously prove the validity\nof the algorithms and analyze their complexity. Our algorithms treat all rounds\nof the reduced cipher as a whole and only concerns the input and output\ndifferences at its both ends, instead of specific differential characteristics.\nTherefore, to a certain extent, they alleviate the weakness of conventional\ndifferential cryptanalysis, namely the difficulties in finding differential\ncharacteristics as the number of rounds increases.",

Using chemical\nvapor deposition, we synthesize a MoS2 monolayer film covered with speckles of\nmultilayer islands, where the growth process is engineered for an optimal\nspeckle density. The physical cryptographic primitive is an array of 2048\npixels fabricated from this film. Using the Clark-Evans test, we confirm that\nthe distribution of islands on the film exhibits complete spatial randomness,\nmaking this cryptographic primitive ideal for security applications. A unique\noptical response is generated by applying an optical stimulus to the structure.\nThe basis for this unique response is the dependence of the photoemission on\nthe number of MoS2 layers which by design is random throughout the film. The\noptical response is used to generate cryptographic keys. Standard security\ntests confirm the uniqueness, reliability, and uniformity of these keys.
